            "Crumbling Structure: The ruin is falling apart, and anyone venturing into it risks bringing it down on top of their heads if they create too much of a commotion. Floors, ceilings, and walls can go at any time.",
            "Cyclical Destruction: Every so often, something happens to kill everything in the ruin; an energy wave, a tide of fast breeding super vermin, inundation by a toxic substance, or the like. This cycle might be triggered by intruders or something they're likely to do.",

            "Lethal Surroundings: The ruin might not be so bad, but the area around it is murderously dangerous. It might be teeming with dangerous creatures, vicious natives, or potentially lethal terrain.",

            "Remote Location: The ruin is exceedingly far away from anything else of importance, and its entrance is probably well hidden. Reaching the ruin will necessitate a long trip at the least, likely through hostile lands to an imprecise destination.",
            "Sealed Entrance: The ruin's entrance is bound shut by magic or ancient technology. Most such seals are too complex and multi layered to be easily opened by Godbound miracles, though a Godbound with the Journeying gift Master of the Key likely could get it open.",

            "Arcane Lore: There are one or more grimoires here containing the details of a theurgic invocation. They might be drawn from the examples given here in the book, or you might make up some new spells for the PCs to discover. Alternately, it might be a cache of instructional materials on a lost form of low magic, one that isn't as potent as theurgy but might still have some effects relevant to the ruin's original purpose.",
            "Celestial Shards: These are needed for artifact crafting and the working of Impossible feats of Dominion. Their presence implies that the ruin was either the original location of a realm side engine of creation or that the ruin's builders brought in scavenged shards from elsewhere. One shard for every two PCs is usually a good haul.",
            "Dark Secret: The ruin contains evidence of some atrocity, crime, or terrible practice that has some meaningful connection to the present day natives of the area. The locals may not even remember their former sins, or they may make a point of hiding them. They might even still be ongoing, and this evidence would be all too clear.",
            "Material Wealth: The Treasure chapter contains guidelines on how much Wealth loot a ruin of a given size and type should have, but this ruin is an exception. You should at least double the expected Wealth, if not more, and place it in some form that would make sense for the ruin's original purpose.",
            "Needed Key: The ruin's reward is a key of some kind. It might be a physical key, or a passcode, or a particular magical ritual to be performed at a particular place. Whatever it is, it's needed to get into someplace important, either another ruin or a lost treasure vault.",
            "Night Road: There's a Night Road in the bowels of this ruin, but unlike most Night Roads, this one can be sealed or opened from the realm side. PCs who take control of the ruin have an easy ingress to whatever far realm or Heavenly shard to which it might connect.",
            "Powerful Artifact: There's a magic item in here powerful enough to impress even a Godbound. It might be a towering godwalker, or it could be a major artifact built with the rules in the Treasure chapter. It's possible that the artifact is somehow connected to the functioning of the ruin, or it might have been lost here by some former unfortunate explorer. Removing it could have consequences.",
            "Revealed Plot: Somewhere in the ruin there's clear evidence of a sinister plot in the outside world or an impending catastrophe about to strike the area. This evidence is enough to warn the PCs, but it shouldn't be enough to prevent the catastrophe or blow open the plot by itself. If the PCs want to pursue the matter, the information should give them a general lead.",
            "Token of Legitimacy: There's a piece of regalia or a genealogical text somewhere in the ruin that either proves the local ruling family is illegitimate or confers that legitimacy on whoever holds it. The token should be impressive or unusual enough to draw the PCs' attention, though they may not realize its importance until they start showing it to other people or have a Godbound of Knowledge or one with a relevant Fact examine it.",
            "Transport Nexus: Fast travel in most realms is limited to the speed of a sailing ship. Long range teleportation magic is very rare and potent theurgy, and even Godbound of Journeying usually have to traverse the physical space between points. This ruin contains a teleportation device or underground tubeway car that connects the ruin to some distant location, probably another ruin of a similar type. The nexus probably can't be re worked to aim at a different target, though GMs might allow it as an Impossible project.",
            "Useful Ally: There's an entity in this ruin that would make a useful and reliable ally to the PCs. Such a being isn't just one of the inhabitants who could be talked or charmed around to obedience, but an automaton or creature with obvious potential as a servant. The PCs should be able to tell that the entity is a potential ally very easily, or else habits of divine smiting might take the fore.",
            "Valuable Map: There's a ruin or cache that nobody knows about, but this map gives relatively clear directions to it. The map might take the form of an actual paper map, or it could be a record kept in the ruin, or an inference drawn from some decorative piece of art. The map might leave out important information about the destination site's defenses or nature."
