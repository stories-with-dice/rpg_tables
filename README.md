## Features

- static HTML & javascript only (you can download it and it's all yours. No need for active internet connection)
- subtable rolls
- custom ranges in tables

## TODOs

- * tables subrolls. I want to roll all the tables under a category

## Collaboration & feedback

Please submit any ideas & feedback you might have as a github issue [here](https://github.com/stories-with-dice/rpg_tables/issues/new)

Feel free to have a look at the code and suggest improvements as well.

Check issues and projects for possible ideas to start.

If you want to add your own tables, look at this example: [Planescape NPC](https://github.com/stories-with-dice/rpg_tables/blob/ad6a7ebf88f60ddd1986ad7d1b07bf42121e1cae/js/roll_menu.js#L2393)

### Adding a new table

- add a new file `roll_your_type.js`
- add this file to `index.html`, like

```html
  <script src="js/roll_modern_horror.js"></script>
```
- add a case in `rolltables.js`

```js
    case "modern_horror":
        return top.modern_horror;
        break;   
```
- if it's got multiple rolls, you need to add it to `roll_menu.js`, like

```js
   {
        id: "modern_horror",
        title: "Modern Horror",
        items: [
            {
                title: "Gothic All",
                use: "",
                sub_rolls: [
                ],
                main_rolls: [
                    "modern_horror/gothic_motifs",
                    "modern_horror/gothic_events",
                    "modern_horror/gothic_locations",
                    "modern_horror/gothic_buildings",
                    "modern_horror/gothic_parts_buildings",
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
```
